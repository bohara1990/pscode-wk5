// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

int a=2
int b=6
int z= a+b
system.out.println(a+b)

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

int w=25
int x=26
int y=27
int z=28
system.out.println(whether the number is odd or even)

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) int=a,b,c,d,e.

b) system.out.println(average of a+b+c+d+e) or {(a+b+c+d+e)/5}

c) if a=1 , b=2, c=3, d=4 and e=5
   system.out.println(smallest number among above five numbers)
   system.out.println(largest number among above five numbers)

d) average of five numbers=3 (odd)
   smallest number among five entered numbers=1 (odd)
   largest number among five entered numbers=5 (odd)
